# TA-Lib
Migration of TA-Lib from SourceForge.

I finally got around to taking a peek at the TA-Lib source code only to realize that the last stable release that most of us have been using dropped in 2004 with the last commit being made in 2013.

While I have not done enough googling in order to conclude why this project was never picked up by any other person or entity for the purposes of continuing development, it's my sincere hope that we can channel some Field of Dreams in that by moving the existing code from SourceForge to GitHub, MAYBE some generous individuals will dedicate some spare cycles to the continued development and upkeep of TA-Lib, especially considering that it's still being downloaded about 6k times a month.
