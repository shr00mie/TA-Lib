# TA-Lib
Migration of TA-Lib from SourceForge.

I finally got around to taking a peek at the TA-Lib source code only to realize that the last stable release that most of us
have been using dropped in 2004 with the last commit being made in 2013.

While I have not done enough googling as to why this project was never picked up by any other person or entity for the purposes
of continuing development, it's my sincere hope that we can channel some Field of Dreams and that by moving the existing code
from SourceForge to GitHub, MAYBE some generous individuals will dedicate some spare cycles to the continued development and
upkeep of TA-Lib.
